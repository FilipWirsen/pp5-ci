* Easy to navigate and to sort for the type of disc your interested in buying.
* Has alot of trustability to make the user feel like they are buying from proffesionals that know what their talking about.
* User accounts to easily keep track of previous orders.
* Let users that bought a product rate it.
* Look at customer reviews on products.

And the most important functionality for the site owner is the following:

* Ability to add, update and delete products. 
* Ability to add discounts to products.
* Allow users to contact the store owner incase they have any questions or if something is not working as expected.

# Agile
 
I have used GitHub issues and projects to implement a basic Agile strategy. I created issues for my user stories and a Kanban board for the project. I've moved each user story from to do to in progress and finally to done to keep track of my user stories and my progress. The Kanban board can be found [here](https://github.com/users/FilipWirsen/projects/4/views/1).

# Scope

To achieve my user stories and thinking about the strategy the website will be created with the following functions:

## User
* Navigation thats shown on every page that contains the following:
    * A link back to the home page.
    * A search bar that lets the user search for specific products.
    * Links to the user profile and a cart that displays total price if its not empty.
    * Link to filter for diffrent types of products and links for deals, course reviews and contact
* A landin page that clearly demonstrates what the site is for.
* A product page that lists all products and can be filtered for best price, rating and name.
* Product details page that shows the products details and allows the user to add it to their cart.
* Registration/login functionality so that users can create and manage their account. Built using django allauth to make sure everything is secure.
* A user profile page so that users can save preferred shipping details and view past orders.
* A custom 404 page to let the users go back to the home page.
* A checkout page to let the users place orders safely and secure.
## Site owner
* Link in the nav to add new products.
* Links under the product details to edit and delete products.
* See customer reviews under the product details.


# Structure

The project structure looks like the following:

Users are greeted with a homepage that lets them know the purpose of the site right away. At the top of the page there is a clear navigation bar that allows the user to get fast access to whatever part of the website their most interested in. If the user scrolls down they can see our best rated prodcuts and below that there's a footer that lets the user sign up to our newsletter, view our social media platforms or get our contact information. Since not all users are going to have an account they can checkout either as a guest or create a personal profile to save past orders and their shipping details.

The website is made of the following apps:

* Home
* Products
* Profile
* Cart
* Checkout
* Course Reviews


# Database Design

<img src="readme_assets/database-design.png">


## Category
The Category model contains all diffrent product categories and it's purpose is to allow users to filter for diffrent categories.

## Products
The Products model is makes it possible for the site owner to add products for sale on the site. Each product has a name, description, price, rating and image. The site owner can also add discounts to products to increse sales for that product.

## Order & OrderLineItems
The Order model holds all order details of an order placed by a user. The OrderLineItems model contains all products in said order. The two models are connected with each other to make this possible.

## Profile
The Profile model makes it possible for users to create an account that
contains all of the their past orders and their prefered shipping details to allow faster and easier checkouts in the future. This also improves the user experience. For this project Iused djangos user model togehter with django allauth to make sure every users information is stored sercurly.

## Review 
The Review model lets users that bought a product rate it and leave a message for the site owner. The products rating changes based on user reviews.

## Course Reviews
The Course Reviews model is created to improve the SEO by linking to external websites and to make users visit the site more frequently and not only to make purchases. The model consists of a course name, author, text, address, rating and image. This model will also make the site more trustworthy.

# Wireframes
All Wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.cloud/)

# Colors and Fonts


## Color Scheme
I have chosen the combination of dark grey colors to enhance the neutrality and balance of the website. To get the users attention I have used bootstraps red (danger) to indicate danger and crucial information such as, total price, shipping etc. I used bootstraps blue (primary) color to highlight text that has information and buttons that I want the user to press. For example, checkout now, login to save order information.

(palette generated at [colormind](http://colormind.io/bootstrap/))


## Font
For the font I  used Oswald witch I imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/about). I used this font for everything because I feel like it has an ability to highlight text and make it feel more natural to read it.

## Design Choices
I made the navbar transparent on the home page to make the whole page be covered in the background image. This made the website feel more welcoming and proffesional leaving the user wanting more and therefore making them explore more of the site. I've also added functionality to remove the navbar on mobile devices when scrolling to a certain height to make the user be able to see everything and not have the screen covered by the navbar.

# Marketing Strategies

## Business Plan
Pro Disc is a B2C business built and designed to sell disc golf discs, appropriate accesories and to create a fanbase of disc golf lovers. Before I started building this website I wrote a marketing plan which you can see below:

Theese are the questions I answered to decide how to market the business the best.

1. Who are your users?
    * All diffrent ages, mostly men but also women. Most of our users will have an active lifestyle, like all kind of diffrent sports and like to be outdoors.
2. Where can you find theese users?
    * Most of our users will be on social platforms such as facebook, instagram and twitter. they´ll follow people with an active lifestyle and people that post about sports.
3. What are your users needs? Are they looking for specific content and if so what type of content and can you provide it to them?
    * Most of our users will be intrested in playing the sport disc golf and a great way to help them visit the site more frequently would be to include course reviews so that there's more content than just buying discs.
4. Is your site going to run sales? When would be the best time to have theese campaigns?
    * Since Disc golf is a sport you play outdoors and mostly during the summer we will have sales start right before the summer and renew them throughout the whole summer.
5. How would your users hear about new products or new campaigns?
    * Most of our users would hear about it either from our newsletter or from any of our social media platforms. We also have plans to sign influencers and make them ambassadors for the website and having them post about us on their social media.

## Marketing platforms

### Newsletter
Users are able to sign up to our newsletter to be the first ones to hear about new products and campaigns

<img src="readme_assets/newsletter.png">

### Facebook
<img src="readme_assets/facebook.png">
The site has its own facebook page witch will be one of our main marketing platforms.

## SEO

I used [soovle](https://soovle.com) to find good keywords to use throughout the website. I then googled theese words to see what type of websites that were showing up. As expected alot of stores and courses were showing up so I knew I ad a few good keywords such as Disc Golf, Disc Golf Lovers, Putt & approach and a few more.

The site has been equipped with a sitemap generated by [xml-sitemaps](https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/) and a robots.txt file.

# Credits
The project walkthrough Boutique Ado from Code Institute original repository.
The structure of this readme has been influenced by alot of diffrent readme files but the one that stuck out the most and Ireally liked was by SamanthaBooth81 for their Project 5.
Without [Stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) Iwould never have been able to complete this project. Now that i've studied full stack development for a while im getting more and more comfortable with knowing what Ishould search for to get the best results and once Ifigured that out stack overflow is a really good weapon to have in your arsenal.

# Acknowledgements
I want to thank my mentor Akshat for pointing me in the right direction and Code Institutes awsome Tutors for their patience and putting up with me even though im really stupid at times.
